  Abstract.\normalfont{} We show that four-dimensional topological Yang-Mills theories, adequatedly coupled to Higgs-like fields, admit representations in terms of massive gauge fields in a non-trivial neighborhood of the minima moduli. Spontaneous BRST symmetry breaking is present in the realified fundamental representation, but absent in the fundamental and adjoint one. Unfortunately, the generation of topological solitons requires a global analysis of their moduli. On the other hand, spontaneous BRST symmetry breaking indicates that local degrees of freedom can be introduced in the physical spectrum of $SU(N) \hookrightarrow SO(2N)$ topological gauge theories, possibly inspiring 4d topological gravity models. Additionally, this result provides rare examples of BRST instability in non-Abelian gauge theories with trivial Gribov problem.

  % Abstract.\normalfont{} We propose a consistent coupling between topological Yang-Mills (TYM) theories and Higgs-like doublets. We show that TYM admit representations in terms of massive gauge fields, monopoles, textures, \textit{etc.}, due to spontaneous gauge symmetry breaking. Spontaneous BRST symmetry breaking is absent in the adjoint models, but present in fundamental ones. The latter hints local degrees of freedom are reintroduced in the physical spectrum of these theories, and might inspire approaches which try to connect topological quantum field theories to local physics.
