  Abstract.\normalfont{} We show that four-dimensional topological Yang-Mills theories, adequately coupled to Higgs-like fields, admit representations in terms of massive gauge fields in a non-trivial neighborhood of the minima moduli. Spontaneous BRST symmetry breaking is absent in the adjoint representation, but present in the realified fundamental one. Solitonic degrees of freedom are possible, but require a global study of the complete moduli. The BRST instability in the realified model indicates that local degrees of freedom can be re-introduced to the physical spectrum of $SU(N) \hookrightarrow SO(2N)$ topological gauge theories, possibly inspiring 4d topological gravity models. This result also provides rare examples of BRST symmetry breaking in non-Abelian gauge theories with trivial Gribov problem.

  % Abstract.\normalfont{} We propose a consistent coupling between topological Yang-Mills (TYM) theories and Higgs-like doublets. We show that TYM admit representations in terms of massive gauge fields, monopoles, textures, \textit{etc.}, due to spontaneous gauge symmetry breaking. Spontaneous BRST symmetry breaking is absent in the adjoint models, but present in fundamental ones. The latter hints local degrees of freedom are reintroduced in the physical spectrum of these theories, and might inspire approaches which try to connect topological quantum field theories to local physics. \bigskip
